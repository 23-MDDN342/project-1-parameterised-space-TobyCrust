### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
EXAMPLE README 

just having a nosy around the code at the moment. going to be doing mostly research into what works within the framework of the code and what looks cool. 


I think what woould be cool to do since the animation is only going to be one second is to try to have geometric shapes looking like they're shifting up and down. grid like circle that breathes inwards and outwards

Have been playing around with noise. I think that this will definately be useful going forwards. I have a few ideas for how to use it such as having and interesting geometric looping pattern but then adding some noise on top of it to change sertain aspects such as colour or size of the shapes. Also updated my code so it has a github pages link.

Idea could be going through some sort of geometric tunnel useing from scroller template. 
new idea is to draw the malenium falcon ship and have it periodically jump into hyper space

idea for water could be have a pirate ship and a normar one fighting and have cannon fire as animation, also have monster underneath

### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space Toby Crust

This is a p5.js sketch that produces a zoom background. It is parameterised to work on any scale. The sketch uses perlin noise to create a underwater flowing effect. The dots flow between differnt noise maps every 5 seconds. The end result is an otherworldly underwater animation.

Made by Toby Crust.

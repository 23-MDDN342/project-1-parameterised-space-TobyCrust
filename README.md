### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
EXAMPLE README 

just having a nosy around the code at the moment. going to be doing mostly research into what works within the framework of the code and what looks cool. 


I think what woould be cool to do since the animation is only going to be one second is to try to have geometric shapes looking like they're shifting up and down. grid like circle that breathes inwards and outwards

Have been playing around with noise. I think that this will definately be useful going forwards. I have a few ideas for how to use it such as having and interesting geometric looping pattern but then adding some noise on top of it to change sertain aspects such as colour or size of the shapes. Also updated my code so it has a github pages link.

Idea could be going through some sort of geometric tunnel useing from scroller template. 
new idea is to draw the malenium falcon ship and have it periodically jump into hyper space

idea for water could be have a pirate ship and a normar one fighting and have cannon fire as animation, also have monster underneath

have looked into perlin noise

big problem of trying to fit it in a one second - a way to olve this could be to have all the particals spawn in a grid at the start and then when they are off screen respawn in those positions again, this would mean that they are looping seemlessly. 
could have bubbles or something, this would show easing. 
idea is to have particles be different when they are in the flow zones
I'm likeing the motion blur and I think it will be useful going forwards. It will make it easier to loop the gif as you can no longer see the induvidual points spawn in.


Hype up read me for hand it: - write it as a portfolio type thing describe what it is and how I made it.
